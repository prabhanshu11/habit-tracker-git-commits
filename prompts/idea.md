i want you to create an app for me which has this kind of aesthetic. It should have a mobile version and desktop version both have same aesthetic but very well optimised from visual art AND utility, theory of graph


Your job is to create a technical prompt for a developer AI, which is higly techically skilled, but lacks long term planning, so we have to give it entire plan.

The app's backend is to monitor all the repos, public and private and tell the user, within 24hrs and within 'last checked', how many commits have been made, as the single important metric to track and then a very flowly, retro, functional, minimalistic UI to get second level metrics, like how many lines for each change, then ability to see the code.

The user is my friend so he get shouldn't deal with my github credentials and login, he will get these metrics outright.

Use the series of screenshots to nail the description of animation, css, style guide etc.
